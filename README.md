# Using LLM to Create Instruct Dataset

In this tutorial go over data versioning techniques using the mushroom app data. We will use Docker to run everything inside containers.

## Run Container

### Run `docker-shell.sh`
Run the startup script to make building & running the container easy

- Make sure you are inside the `llm-create-dataset` folder and open a terminal at this location
- Run `sh docker-shell.sh`
- After container startup, test the shell by running `python cli,py --help`
